	"Menu_Home_Para1": "came into being on 12th of January 2005, which marked the 142nd birth anniversary of the guiding light of our lives, Swami Vivekananda. We are driven by the principles and ideals laid down by our revered Swamiji and we dedicate ourselves in character building and awakening the humane qualities amongst the youth of our times. In this regard our Sangha conducts multiple study circles on weekly and fortnightly basis across different districts in West Bengal. We intend to extend our study circles to different corners of our country in the near future as envisaged by Swami Vivekananda.",
    "Menu_Home_Para2_Study_Circle": "Apart from the study circles, ",
	"Menu_Home_Para2": " also engages itself in a plethora of social activities throughout the year in the form of different blood donation, Health and Eye check up events, Flood Relief camp and the likes. We also extend our arms of encouragement to needy students by providing school level coaching and simultaneously train those who wish to appear for various Govt Service Exams.",
	"Menu_Home_Para3": "Admirers and devotees of Swamiji who can relate to our path through which we intend to carry forward our governing guru's vision are cordially invited to join us in this journey of enlightenment of ourselves and the society around us by contributing either mentally, physically or financially as per their convenience. We look forward to walking side by side with you all in realising Swamiji's vision.",
		
	"Menu_philosophy": "PHILOSOPHY",
	"Menu_philosophy_Header_Text": "Our Philosophy",
	
	"Menu_philosophy_Para1": "consists of the eternal principles of Vedanta revealed by Ramakrishna-Vivekananda by their lives and thoughts which are applicable for personality development and character building of the student youth. This ideology has three characteristics: it is modern in the sense that the ancient principles of Vedanta have been expressed in the modern idiom; it is universal, that is, it is meant for the whole humanity; it is practical in the sense that its principles can be applied in day-to-day life to solve the problems of life. The basic principles of this ideology are given below:",
    "Menu_philosophy_SubPoint1": "1. God realization is the ultimate goal of life: ",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubPoint1_Para": "One of the important discoveries made in ancient India was that the universe arises from and is sustained by infinite consciousness called Brahman. It has both impersonal and personal aspects. The personal aspect is known by different names, such as God, Ishvar, Jehovah and so on. Realization of this Ultimate Reality is the true goal of life, for that alone can give us everlasting fulfilment and peace.",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubPoint2": "2. Potential divinity of the soul: ",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubPoint2_Para": "Brahman is immanent in all beings as the Atman which is man’s true self and source of all happiness. But owing to ignorance, he identifies himself with his body and mind and runs after sense pleasures. This is the cause of all evil and suffering. As ignorance is removed, the Atman manifests itself more and more. This manifestation of potential divinity is the essence of true religion.",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubPoint3": "3. Synthesis of the Yogas:",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubPoint3_Para": " The removal of ignorance and manifestation of inner divinity leading to God realization are achieved through Yoga. There are four main Yogas: Jnana Yoga (Yoga of Knowledge); Bhakti Yoga (Yoga of Devotion); Raja Yoga (Yoga of Meditation); Karma Yoga (Yoga of Work). Each Yoga is an independent means of realizing God. But since each Yoga involves the cultivation of one of the faculties such as reason, feeling or will, a combination of all the four Yogas is necessary for the development of a balanced, ‘fully functioning’ personality. It is this synthesis of Yogas that Swami Vivekananda regarded as the ideal of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission and it is our ideal as well.",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubPoint4": "4. Morality based on strength: ",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubPoint4_Para": "According to Swami Vivekananda, weakness is the main cause of immorality, evil and suffering in life, and the cause of weakness is ignorance about one’s true nature as the Atman. Knowledge of the Atman gives us tremendous strength to overcome our weakness and lead a virtuous life. Everyone is endowed with so many potentialities, but owing to fear and weakness, most of these potentialities remain unactualized. When, through knowledge of the Atman, fear and weakness are overcome, these potentialities manifest themselves. Swamiji called this process ‘man-making education’.",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubPoint5": "5. Harmony of Religions: ",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubPoint5_Para": "Although the idea that ‘one Reality is known by different names’ (Vedas) and the idea that ‘different spiritual paths lead to the same goal’ (Gita) are found in the Hindu scriptures and in the teachings of several Hindu saints, Sri Ramakrishna was the first person in history to show through direct experience the transcendental unity of all religions.",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubPoint6": "6. A New Philosophy of Work: ",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubPoint6_Para": "Swami Vivekananda has given a new philosophy of work for the modern world. All work is done according to this philosophy of work, which is based on the following principles.",

    "Menu_philosophy_SubSubPoint1": "a. All work is sacred: ",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubSubPoint1_Para": "According to Vedanta, the physical universe is a manifestation of God known as Virát. Hence, as Sister Nivedita has stated, there is ‘no distinction between the sacred and the secular’. What this statement means is that all work is sacred. Even menial work such as sweeping the floor or mending shoes is to be done with as much attention and devotion as work in the shrine.",
    "Menu_philosophy_SubSubPoint2": "b. Work as worship: ",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubSubPoint2_Para": "The Gita (18.46 & 9.24) states that the all-pervading God is the ultimate source of all work and the enjoyer of the fruits of all sacrifice. Hence all work is to be done as worship and the fruits of actions are to be offered to the Lord.",
    "Menu_philosophy_SubSubPoint3": "c. Service to man is service to God: ",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubSubPoint3_Para": "One of the important principles Swami Vivekananda learned from his Master was ‘Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva’, ‘to serve Jiva as Shiva’. Since man is potentially Divine, service to man is indeed service to God. Instead of looking upon a needy person as an object of pity, he is looked upon as an object of worship. Such an attitude elevates both the giver and the recipient.",
    "Menu_philosophy_SubSubPoint4": "d. Focus on service to the poor and the downtrodden: ",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubSubPoint4_Para": "Swami Vivekananda was the first religious leader in India to speak for the poor and the downtrodden and to state boldly, ‘He who sees Shiva in the poor, in the weak and the diseased, really worships Shiva; and … with him Shiva is more pleased than with the man who sees Him only in temples.’ It was Swamiji who coined the word daridra-náráyana to refer to the poor. Swamiji’s love and concern for the poor continues as a directive principle of Vivekananda Samidh Sangha's service programmes.",
    "Menu_philosophy_SubSubPoint5": "e. Work is a spiritual discipline: ",
	"Menu_philosophy_SubSubPoint5_Para": "When work, any work, is done fulfilling the above conditions, it becomes a spiritual discipline: the mind gets purified and the potential Divinity of the soul manifests itself more and more. Thus work done as a worshipful service benefits the doer himself spiritually: it becomes a spiritual discipline or Yoga. It is with this understanding of work as a spiritual discipline (Karma Yoga) that all the service activities of our Sangha, such as giving food and clothing to the poor, nursing the sick, educating students, performing workshops on personality development etc, are undertaken. Thus service done as worship of God in man helps in two ways: it helps physically or mentally the person who is served, and it helps spiritually the person who serves.",
